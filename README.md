# ai_multi_agent blog generator 🤖✍️
An AI multi-agent system for generating a blog post.


## 📖 Project Origin

This project originated as an assignment from the **"Agents Intensive - Capstone Project"** online intensive, offered by **Google** and **Kaggle**. The initial implementation served as hands-on practice for developing AI agent systems. 

## 🚀 Enhanced Features & Improvements

This repository contains an **enhanced** version of the training script with the following key improvements:

*   **Usability:** Added capabilities for the script to accepts a user-defined topic as input.
*   **Improved Code:** Fixed several minor bugs and dependency issues that prevented the script from running successfully on different environments (e.g., my local machine).
*   **Modernized Architecture**: Refactored core execution logic from synchronous to asynchronous using Python's `asyncio`.
